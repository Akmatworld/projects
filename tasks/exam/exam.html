        <h2 class="article-headline">Once Upon A Time, There Was A Dog Named Hachiko</h2>
        <p><img title="Hachiko" class="dog-img" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTKZCQCdunCSMc0TVZKn6WX6uR7CDrsJNTtnB_hUcM1OPtGXFXhHPZL439wuCLTjZG_1ig&usqp=CAU" alt="Hachiko">Eizaburo Ueno, a professor in agriculture science at Tokyo University in Japan, had long wanted a purebred Japanese Akita dog. He had looked for the perfect Akita puppy for a long time, until one of his students encouraged him to adopt Hachiko, from the Odate city in the Akita prefecture of Japan.</p>
        <p>Hachiko, or Hachi which became his nickname, and his new owner soon became best friends. Eizaburo loved his dear dog above all and treated him as his son. The two of them were inseparable.</p>
        <p>As Hachiko grew older, he started to see his owner off to work in the morning at the Shibuya Train Station, in central Tokyo and went to pick him up at the station in the afternoon when he returned from work.</p>
        <p>On May 21, 1925, only two years after Hachiko was born, Hachiko was as usually sitting by the exit at Shibuya train station waiting for his dear Eizaburo. But his owner never showed up…..</p>
        <p>It turned out that Eizaburo had suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage and died suddenly and unexpectedly while at work.</p>
        <p>Hachiko moved in with a former gardener of the Ueno family. But throughout the rest of his ten-year-long life, he kept going to the Shibuya Train Station every morning and afternoon precisely when the train was due to enter the station. He sat there for hours, patiently waiting in vain for the return of his beloved owner which sadly never came back.</p>
        <p>A major Japanese newspaper reporter picked up the story of Hachiko in 1932 and published it, which led to Hachiko becoming a celebrity all over Japan.</p>
        <p>
        People started calling him “Chuken-Hachiko“, which means “Hachiko – the faithful dog“.
        </p>
        <p>The story of the dog that never gave up gained a lot of attention also in national media, inspiring many people from all over the world to visit Hachiko at Shibuya Train Station to offer him treats. He touched the hearts of the Japanese people and soon became their hero.</p>
